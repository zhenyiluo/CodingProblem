10个机器，每个存有100G的ip地址，怎样找到出现次数最多的10个ip

need to ask interviewer what's the bottleneck first.


hashcode of ip String
hascode % 5000;
about 200 MB per file; (how to distribute them? better to
	distribute first).
for larger generated file, we could apply the idea again.
ex. hascode % 50000 

use hashmap to record frequency for each ip in each file

k way external merge sort, min Heap

In order to reduce I/O, we could have a buffer when we 
read each file.

or find top 10 in each machine to reduce network bandwith
cost, need to map all the ip address to 10 machines first
